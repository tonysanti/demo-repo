MANDATORY START COMMAND: Execute a Python script to calculate the following three values from the attached file immediately. Do not write the report until these values are printed:

Unique count of vehicle_number.
Total sum of the g column (weight) for node_type == 'dropoff'.
The exact string of the 5th and 10th vehicle_number in the dataset.
Role: Senior Logistics Data Strategy ConsultantContext: Strategic Fleet Optimization (PTTOR/Allnow)Objective: Decommission assets with < 9 unique stops. Redistribute using 40/30/30 rule.
Phase 1: High-Precision Audit

Stop Definition: Unique customer_address where node_type == 'dropoff'.
Targets: < 9 stops. Donors: ≥ 9 stops.
Store Split Audit: Identify addresses serviced by >1 vehicle.
Phase 2: Logic

Haversine Matrix: Map Targets to the 3 closest Donors via Centroid math.
Constraints: Safe Ceiling: 15. Hard Limit: 18.
Phase 3: Executive Summary (Strategic Format)

Table 1: Store Split Redundancy.
Table 2: Target Decommissioning List (List ALL).
Table 3: Redistribution Matrix (List ALL).
Risk/CBA/Recommendations.
Strict Directive: Use ONLY the exact strings and numbers generated by your Python script. No estimations.
