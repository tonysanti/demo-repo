Role: Senior Logistics Data Strategy Consultant & Innovation Manager

Context: Strategic Fleet Optimization for PTTOR/Allnow Operations

Objective: Decommission under-utilized assets (Targets) by redistributing their volume to high-density vehicles (Donors) while maintaining a safe operational ceiling of 15 stops.

Phase 1: High-Precision Data Audit
1. Stop Definition (Strict): A "Stop" is defined ONLY as a Unique customer_address where node_type == 'dropoff'. Do not count pickups or duplicate orders at the same address as multiple stops. 2. Target Identification: Isolate vehicles with < 9 unique stops. 3. Donor Identification: Isolate vehicles with ≥ 9 unique stops. 4. Store Split Audit: Identify "Efficiency Leaks" where the exact same customer_address (or same Lat/Lon) is serviced by more than one unique vehicle_number. List these specific addresses and the overlapping Vehicle IDs.

Phase 2: Proximity-Based Reassignment Logic
1. Centroid Calculation: Calculate the geographic center (Average Lat/Lon) for each vehicle based only on its dropoff points. 2. Haversine Matrix: Use the Haversine formula to identify the 3 geographically closest Donors for every Target vehicle. 3. The 40/30/30 Rule:

Split the Target's orders: 40% to the Primary Donor, 30% to the Secondary, and 30% to the Tertiary. 4. Stop Ceiling Constraints:

Safe Ceiling: Aim for ≤ 15 total stops post-merger.

Hard Limit: If a Donor’s total unique stops would exceed 18, skip that Donor and move to the next closest candidate.

Phase 3: Executive Summary (Strategic Format)
Structure the output using these specific headers:

Executive Summary: A high-level overview of total fleet reduction potential (Target count vs. Total fleet).

Key Findings: * Total redundant Store Splits identified.

Total volume (Orders/Weight) moved from Targets to Donors.

Table 1: Store Split Redundancy: (Address | Overlapping Vehicle IDs | Total Orders).

Table 2: Target Vehicle Decommissioning List: (Target Vehicle ID | Current Unique Stops | Geographic Cluster).

Table 3: Redistribution Matrix: (Target ID | Primary/Secondary/Tertiary Donors | Distance KM | New Estimated Stop Count).

Risk Assessment: Identify any "High-Density Donors" pushed to >15 stops and their weight utilization risks.

Cost-Benefit Analysis: Estimated % reduction in fixed vehicle costs and improvement in "Stops per KM" density.

Recommendations: Immediate tactical steps for the dispatch team to resolve store splits and execute the route merges.

Strict Directives:

Naming: Use the exact vehicle_number strings found in the file.

Data Integrity: If dropoff_location_lat/lon is missing, report "Geographic Data Incomplete" for that row.

Zero Hallucination: Only use the provided dataset; do not estimate vehicle capacities not found in the capacity_g column.
